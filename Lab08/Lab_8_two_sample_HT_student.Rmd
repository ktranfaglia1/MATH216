# Lab 8: Comparing Two Population Means

Today we are going to look at conducting hypothesis tests when we have two samples of data. Recall the steps we want to take when running a hypothesis test:

1.  A description the null and alternative hypotheses in terms of the problem.

2.  A statement of the null and alternative hypotheses in standard symbols.

3.  The significance level (size of the Type I error), α, that will be tolerated.

4.  The name of the statistical test to be used and the assumptions required in order for the test to be valid. (i.e. small sample size, not approximately normal, paired, independent, etc.)

5.  A clear description of exactly what the decision rule is; i.e. under what circumstances is the null hypothesis rejected.

6.  A clear statement indicating whether or not you actually reject H0. This decision must be linked to the numerical value of p actually observed and the value of α.

7.  A very clear description of what was actually decided in the context of the original problem. For example, if the problem is about mean airfares between two cities, simply saying reject Ho is not good enough; you need to say what this decision means as it applies to mean airfares.

8.  Any statistical decision method is subject to Type I or Type II error. Discuss which type is possible in your final decision and if possible, its probability.

When we have two samples we need to first consider the relationship between the data. There are two different relationships we can have between the data:

**Independent Samples**: A random sample of size $n_1$ is selected from the first population, and a random sample of size $n_2$ is selected *independently* from the second population. The null hypothesis usually is $\mu_1=\mu_2$ .Then $\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2$is calculated, but this time a *2-sample test* is used; there is no way to view the data as a single sample.

When the sample sizes are small and the the both populations are not normal a Mann-Whitney test can sometimes be used. The Mann-Whitney test would be used if the two samples have a distribution with the same shape. in addition the Mann-Whitney test is not about $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$, but about the population medians $\eta_1$ and $\eta_2$. so the two hypotheses become:

$H_0: \eta_1=\eta_2 \\$ $H_1: \eta_1 \neq,\lt,\gt \eta_2$

**Paired Samples** When the two samples have the same sample size and each data point in one sample can be *paired* with another data point in the other sample. The difference between the populations means is denoted $\mu_d=\mu_1-\mu_2$. Here the null hypothesis is that $\mu_d=0$. Now this can be treated as a single sample and a 1-sample hypothesis can br run on the **sample differences**.

In order to run either of these tests we can use the t.test(), or wilcox.test() commands that we discussed in the previous lab.

To run an independent 2-sample t-test we would use the following syntax: t.test(sample1,sample2)

to run an independent Mann-whitney test we would use the following syntax: wilcox.test(sample1,sample2,alternative='two.sided','less','greater')

To run a paired t-test we use the following syntax: t.test(sample1,sample2,paired=TRUE)

for today's lab we will data from the pulse.csv. The data relates to a class of statistic students that measured their resting pulse (Pulse1) and then a random number of students ran in place while the others just stayed still. The pulses of the entire class were recorded again (Pulse2). Along with the pulse data other data was collected that included, height, weight, sex, and weather or not they smoked.

For reference here is a more detailed summary of the data:

In this data set, there are 8 variables:

-   Pulse1: The resting pulse of each student
-   Pulse2: The pulse after running or not running for each student (after treatment)
-   Ran: Whether or not the student ran in place: 1=Yes or 2=No (treatment)
-   Smokes: Whether or not the student smokes regularly: 1=Yes or 2=No
-   Sex: The biological characteristics of males or females of the student: 1=M or 2=F
-   Height: The height of the student, in inches
-   Weight: The weight of the student, in pounds
-   Activity: The usual activity level of the student: 1=Slight, 2=Moderate, or 3=A lot

## Assignment 2

A researcher wants to test the hypothesis that the average pulse of the class was greater the second time around than the first time. Conduct the appropriate test to test this hypothesis and clearly state your conclusion following the 8 steps described above.

```{r}

t.test(x=Diffs, mu=0, alternative = "less", conf.level = 0.95)
```

```         
Alternative Hypothesis HA: mu_pulse2 > mu_pulse1

Since it is paired, take the difference to combine two samples into one: Diffs

Alternative Hypothesis HA becomes mu_diffs < 0

One sample test.
Sample size n for Diffs is 92 > 30
Sigma of Diffs known? No

1-sample t test should be used

1. Null: the average pulse of the class is equal the second time and the first time
   Alternative: the average pulse of the class was greater the second time around than the first time
  
2. H0: mu_pulse2 = mu_pulse1 vs HA: mu_pulse2 > mu_pulse1

3. Alpha = 0.05, it is the probability of making type 1 error. It is also the probability we use to define an unsual event.

4. Since the sample size n = 92 >= 30, it is a large sample. Since we are not given the population standard deviation, sigma, we should use 1-sample t.

5. If the computed p-value < alpha, we have sufficient evidence to reject H0 and to support HA. If the computed p-value >= alpha, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject H0 and we do not have sufficient evidence to support HA.

p-value = probability of getting such a sample (or more extreme sample) if we assume H0 is true.

6. Using R to compute the p-value = 1.012e-06 < 0.05 = alpha. This sample of 92 pulse data provides sufficient evidence to reject H0 and to support HA. 

7. It means, the sample provides sufficient evidence to support the statement: "the average pulse of the class was greater the second time around than the first time."

8. The above decision is possible to be an error

   Type I error: reject H0 when it is true (p-value < alpha).
   Type II error: failed to reject H0 when it is not true (p-value >= alpha).
   
   Since our decision is reject H0, it is possible to be a type I error with the      probability alpha = 0.05.
```

**End Assignment 2**

Now it probably makes sense to separate the class into two groups, the runners and the non-runners.

## Assignment 3

A researcher now wants to look at the pulses of the running group before and after to conclude whether or not running in place increases mean heart rate. Conduct the appropriate test to test this hypothesis and clearly state your conclusion following the 8 steps described above.

```{r}

t.test(x=Diffs_R, mu=0, alternative = "less", conf.level = 0.95)

```

```         
Perform Two Hypothesis Tests

one for DIffs_R

another for Diffs_NR

check if mu_Diffs_R < 0
check if mu_Diffs_NR < 0

what conclusion can you draw from the above results?

All segment requiurments:
1. H0 and HA
2. Compute p-value
3. Draw conclusion based on p-value using alpha=0.05
4. Explain the menaing of the conclusion

For Runners:

1. Null: running in place does not change mean heart rate
   Alternative: running in place increases mean heart rate
  
2. H0: mu_pulse2 = mu_pulse1 vs HA: mu_pulse2 > mu_pulse1

3. Alpha = 0.05, it is the probability of making type 1 error. It is also the probability we use to define an unsual event.

4. Since the sample size n = 35 >= 30, it is a large sample. Since we are not given the population standard deviation, sigma, we should use 1-sample t.

5. If the computed p-value < alpha, we have sufficient evidence to reject H0 and to support HA. If the computed p-value >= alpha, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject H0 and we do not have sufficient evidence to support HA.

p-value = probability of getting such a sample (or more extreme sample) if we assume H0 is true.

6. Using R to compute the p-value = 6.324e-09 < 0.05 = alpha. This sample of 35 pulse data provides sufficient evidence to reject H0 and to support HA. 

7. It means, the sample provides sufficient evidence to support the statement: "running in place increases mean heart rate."

8. The above decision is possible to be an error

   Type I error: reject H0 when it is true (p-value < alpha).
   Type II error: failed to reject H0 when it is not true (p-value >= alpha).
   
   Since our decision is reject H0, it is possible to be a type I error with the      probability alpha = 0.05.
   
```

**End Assignment 3**

## Assignment 4

A researcher now wants to run the same hypothesis as before but with the non-runners to see if there is any difference in mean heart rate. Conduct the appropriate test to test this hypothesis and clearly state your conclusion following the 8 steps described above.

```{r}

t.test(x=Diffs_NR, mu=0, alternative = "less", conf.level = 0.95)
```

```         
For Non-Runners:

1. Null: running in place does not change mean heart rate
   Alternative: running in place increases mean heart rate
  
2. H0: mu_pulse2 = mu_pulse1 vs HA: mu_pulse2 > mu_pulse1

3. Alpha = 0.05, it is the probability of making type 1 error. It is also the probability we use to define an unsual event.

4. Since the sample size n = 57 >= 30, it is a large sample. Since we are not given the population standard deviation, sigma, we should use 1-sample t.

5. If the computed p-value < alpha, we have sufficient evidence to reject H0 and to support HA. If the computed p-value >= alpha, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject H0 and we do not have sufficient evidence to support HA.

p-value = probability of getting such a sample (or more extreme sample) if we assume H0 is true.

6. Using R to compute the p-value = 0.5754 > 0.05 = alpha. This sample of 57 pulse data does not provide sufficient evidence to reject H0 or to support HA. 

7. It means, the sample does not provide sufficient evidence to support the statement: "running in place increases mean heart rate." nor reject "running in place does not change mean heart rate."

8. The above decision is possible to be an error

   Type I error: reject H0 when it is true (p-value < alpha).
   Type II error: failed to reject H0 when it is not true (p-value >= alpha).
   
   Since our decision is to fail to reject H0, it is possible to be a type II error with the probability beta.
```

**End Assignment 4**

## Assignment 5

Now among the runners there could be another factor that affects the average heart rate. This confounding factor could be smoking. Therefore the researcher wants to know does the mean heart rate of smokers increase after running in place? Conduct the appropriate test to test this hypothesis and clearly state your conclusion following the 8 steps described above. You may have a small sample size and it is non-normal you may have to use the Wilcoxon or Sign tests discussed in the previous lab.

```{r}
# Check normality
ad.test(Diffs_RandS)

qqPlot(Diffs_RandS)

# Data approximately normal - continue with 1-sample t test
t.test(x=Diffs_RandS, mu=0, alternative = "less", conf.level = 0.95)

```

```         
For Runners that Smoke:

1. Null: running in place does not change mean heart rate of smokers
   Alternative: running in place increases mean heart rate of smokers
  
2. H0: mu_pulse2 = mu_pulse1 vs HA: mu_pulse2 > mu_pulse1

3. Alpha = 0.05, it is the probability of making type 1 error. It is also the probability we use to define an unsual event.

4. Since the sample size n = 12 < 30, it is a small sample. So, we must determine if the sample is approximately normal. Using the Anderson-Darling test, we find that p-value = 0.9743 > 0.05 = Alpha. With this, considering the support from the qqplot which presents a graph resembling a normal distribution, we can say that the data set is approximately normal. Thus, since sigma is not know for the data set, we use a 1-sample t test.

5. If the computed p-value < alpha, we have sufficient evidence to reject H0 and to support HA. If the computed p-value >= alpha, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject H0 and we do not have sufficient evidence to support HA.

p-value = probability of getting such a sample (or more extreme sample) if we assume H0 is true.

6. Using R to compute the p-value = 0.0008227 < 0.05 = alpha. This sample of 12 pulse data provides sufficient evidence to reject H0 or to support HA. 

7. It means, the sample provides sufficient evidence to support the statement: "running in place increases mean heart rate for smokers."

8. The above decision is possible to be an error

   Type I error: reject H0 when it is true (p-value < alpha).
   Type II error: failed to reject H0 when it is not true (p-value >= alpha).
   
   Since our decision is to reject H0, it is possible to be a type I error with the probability alpha = 0.05.
```

**End Assignment 5**

## Assignment 6

Now to make a comparison the next hypothesis would be does running in place increase the mean heart rate of non-smokers? Conduct the appropriate test to test this hypothesis and clearly state your conclusion following the 8 steps described above.

```{r}
# Check normality
ad.test(Diffs_RandNS)

qqPlot(Diffs_RandNS)

# Data approximately normal - continue with 1-sample t test
t.test(x=Diffs_RandNS, mu=0, alternative = "less", conf.level = 0.95)
```

```         
For Runners that do not Smoke:

1. Null: running in place does not change mean heart rate of non-smokers
   Alternative: running in place increases mean heart rate of non-smokers
  
2. H0: mu_pulse2 = mu_pulse1 vs HA: mu_pulse2 > mu_pulse1

3. Alpha = 0.05, it is the probability of making type 1 error. It is also the probability we use to define an unsual event.

4. Since the sample size n = 23 < 30, it is a small sample. So, we must determine if the sample is approximately normal. Using the Anderson-Darling test, we find that p-value = 0.05524 > 0.05 = Alpha. With this, considering the support from the qqplot which presents a graph resembling a normal distribution (although the resemblance is weak), we can say that the data set is approximately normal as we cannot reject that the data set is not normal. Thus, since sigma is not know for the data set, we use a 1-sample t test.

5. If the computed p-value < alpha, we have sufficient evidence to reject H0 and to support HA. If the computed p-value >= alpha, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject H0 and we do not have sufficient evidence to support HA.

p-value = probability of getting such a sample (or more extreme sample) if we assume H0 is true.

6. Using R to compute the p-value = 1.113e-06 < 0.05 = alpha. This sample of 23 pulse data provides sufficient evidence to reject H0 or to support HA. 

7. It means, the sample provides sufficient evidence to support the statement: "running in place increases mean heart rate for non-smokers."

8. The above decision is possible to be an error

   Type I error: reject H0 when it is true (p-value < alpha).
   Type II error: failed to reject H0 when it is not true (p-value >= alpha).
   
   Since our decision is to reject H0, it is possible to be a type I error with the probability alpha = 0.05.
```

**End Assignment 6**

## Assignment 7

Now a researcher is interested in the weights of the class. They want to determine whether the weights of males and females differ.Conduct the appropriate test to test this hypothesis and clearly state your conclusion following the 8 steps described above. ( if using a non-parametric test remember to state the conclusion in terms of means and not medians)

```{r}

t.test(x=Weight_M, y = Weight_F, mu=0, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.95)
```

```         
Male - Female weight difference analysis:

1. Null: the weights of males and females do not differ
   Alternative: the weights of males and females differ
  
2. H0: mu_pulse2 = mu_pulse1 vs HA: mu_pulse2 != mu_pulse1

3. Alpha = 0.05, it is the probability of making type 1 error. It is also the probability we use to define an unsual event.

4. Since the sample size n1 = 57 >= 30 and n2 = 35 >= 30, it is a large sample. However, since n1 != n2, these samples are not paired. Considering that the samples are not paired but the samples are large with an unkown sigma, we will use 2-sample t test.

5. If the computed p-value < alpha, we have sufficient evidence to reject H0 and to support HA. If the computed p-value >= alpha, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject H0 and we do not have sufficient evidence to support HA.

p-value = probability of getting such a sample (or more extreme sample) if we assume H0 is true.

6. Using R to compute the p-value = 2.2e-16 < 0.05 = alpha. This sample of 57 male and 35 female weight data provides sufficient evidence to reject H0 or to support HA. 

7. It means, the sample provides sufficient evidence to support the statement: "the weights of males and females differ."

8. The above decision is possible to be an error

   Type I error: reject H0 when it is true (p-value < alpha).
   Type II error: failed to reject H0 when it is not true (p-value >= alpha).
   
   Since our decision is to reject H0, it is possible to be a type I error with the probability alpha = 0.05.

## Assignment 8

Going a little deeper into the data a researcher thinks that smoking might have an effect on weight. The researcher wants to test the hypothesis about whether the mean weight of males who smoke is different from males who do not smoke. Conduct the appropriate test to test this hypothesis and clearly state your conclusion following the 8 steps described above. ( if using a non-parametric test remember to state the conclusion in terms of means and not medians)

```{r}
# Check normality
ad.test(Weight_M_S)

qqPlot(Weight_M_S)

# Data approximately normal - Continue with 2-sample t test
t.test(x=Weight_M_S, y = Weight_M_NS, mu=0, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.95)
```

```         
Male smokers - Male non-smokers weight difference analysis:

1. Null: the weights of males smokers and male non-smokers do not differ
   Alternative: the weights of males smokers and male non-smokers differ
  
2. H0: mu_pulse2 = mu_pulse1 vs HA: mu_pulse2 != mu_pulse1

3. Alpha = 0.05, it is the probability of making type 1 error. It is also the probability we use to define an unsual event.

4. Since the sample size n1 = 20 < 30 and n2 = 37 >= 30, we can not consider this a large sample. Although, the sample size of n2, male non-smokers is greater than 30, the sample size of n1 is less than 30. So, since n1 != n2 and the sample size of n1 is not large, we must test if the small sample n1, male smokers, is approximately normal. Using the Anderson-Darling test, we find that p-value = 0.6017 > 0.05 = Alpha. With this, considering the support from the qqplot which presents a graph resembling a normal distribution, we can say that the data set is approximately normal as we cannot reject that the data set is not normal. Thus, since sigma is not know for the data set, and we can say that n1 is approximately normal by Anderson-Darling test and n2 is approximately normal by CLT, we use a 2-sample t test.

5. If the computed p-value < alpha, we have sufficient evidence to reject H0 and to support HA. If the computed p-value >= alpha, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject H0 and we do not have sufficient evidence to support HA.

p-value = probability of getting such a sample (or more extreme sample) if we assume H0 is true.

6. Using R to compute the p-value = 0.1834 > 0.05 = alpha. This sample of 20 male smokers and 37 male non-smokers weight data does not provide sufficient evidence to reject H0 nor to support HA. 

7. It means, the sample does not provide sufficient evidence to support the statement: "the weights of males smokers and male non-smokers differ." nor to reject the statement "the weights of males smokers and male non-smokers do not differ."

8. The above decision is possible to be an error

   Type I error: reject H0 when it is true (p-value < alpha).
   Type II error: failed to reject H0 when it is not true (p-value >= alpha).
   
   Since our decision is fail to reject H0, it is possible to be a type II error with the probability beta.

## Assignment 9

The last hypothesis that the researcher want to test is whether the mean weight of females who smoke is different from females who do not smoke. Conduct the appropriate test to test this hypothesis and clearly state your conclusion following the 8 steps described above. ( if using a non-parametric test remember to state the conclusion in terms of means and not medians)

```{r}
# Check normality for female smokers
ad.test(Weight_F_S)

qqPlot(Weight_F_S)

# Check normality for female non-smokers
ad.test(Weight_F_NS)

qqPlot(Weight_F_NS)

# Data approximately normal - Continue with 2-sample t test
t.test(x=Weight_F_S, y = Weight_F_NS, mu=0, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.95)
```

```         
Female smokers - Female non-smokers weight difference analysis:

1. Null: the weights of females smokers and female non-smokers do not differ
   Alternative: the weights of females smokers and female non-smokers differ
  
2. H0: mu_pulse2 = mu_pulse1 vs HA: mu_pulse2 != mu_pulse1

3. Alpha = 0.05, it is the probability of making type 1 error. It is also the probability we use to define an unsual event.

4. Since the sample size n1 = 8 < 30 and n2 = 27 < 30, we can not consider this a large sample. The sample size of n2, female non-smokers is less than 30 and the sample size of n1, female smokers is less than 30. So, since n1 != n2 and the sample size of n1 and n2 is not large, we must test if the samples are approximately normal. Using the Anderson-Darling test, we find that p-value = 0.867 > 0.05 = Alpha for n1, female smokers and p-value = 0.3744 > .05 for n2, female non-smokers. With this, considering the support from the qqplot which presents a graph resembling a normal distribution for both n1 and n2, we can say that both data sets are approximately normal as we cannot reject that the data sets are not normal. Thus, since sigma is not know for the data set, and we can say that n1 and n2 are approximately normal by Anderson-Darling test, we use a 2-sample t test.

5. If the computed p-value < alpha, we have sufficient evidence to reject H0 and to support HA. If the computed p-value >= alpha, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject H0 and we do not have sufficient evidence to support HA.

p-value = probability of getting such a sample (or more extreme sample) if we assume H0 is true.

6. Using R to compute the p-value = 0.5281 > 0.05 = alpha. This sample of 8 female smokers and 27 female non-smokers weight data does not provide sufficient evidence to reject H0 nor to support HA. 

7. It means, the sample does not provide sufficient evidence to support the statement: "the weights of females smokers and female non-smokers differ." nor to reject the statement "the weights of females smokers and female non-smokers do not differ."

8. The above decision is possible to be an error

   Type I error: reject H0 when it is true (p-value < alpha).
   Type II error: failed to reject H0 when it is not true (p-value >= alpha).
   
   Since our decision is fail to reject H0, it is possible to be a type II error with the probability beta.

## Conclusion assignment

Based on the hypotheses you have tested and there results write a concluding paragraph or more about your findings:

```         
After conducting the 8 hypothesis test, we can draw some conclusions. We can say from the test that the average pulse of the class was greater the second time around than the first time. We can also say that running in place increases mean heart rate for runners but we can not say that running in place increases mean heart rate for non-runners. In analyzing how smoking impacts heart rate, from the hypothesis tests we can say that running in place increases mean heart rate for smokers and running in place increases mean heart rate for non-smokers. For male and female weight analysis, we can say from the hypothesis testing that the weights of males and females differ. In considering how smoking impacts male and female weight, we can not say that the weights of males smokers and male non-smokers do not differ or the weights of females smokers and female non-smokers do not differ as we could not reject that the weights of males smokers and male non-smokers do not differ or the weights of females smokers and female non-smokers do not differ. In conclusion, from the hypothesis tests, we can say that running in place increases mean heart rate for both smokers and non-smokers, male and female weights differ, and that smoking likely does not change the weight for males nor females.
